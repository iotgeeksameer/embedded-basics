start condition:
High to Low transition of SDA line when SCL is High.

stop condition:
low to high transition of SDA line when SCL is High.


Data on the SDA  line must remain stable during the high phase of the clock period, 
as changes in the data line when the SCL is high are interpreted as control commands (START or STOP)
